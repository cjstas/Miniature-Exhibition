Theme: Tiny Creatures

Concept
Game where you purchase a variety of creatures to keep in your exhibit. Each creature produces some resources which are used to expand your exhibit (get new creatures, etc)
New creatures. Player interaction comes from needing to feed, water, & clean the creatures. The goal is to eventually automate this
	simple top down, retro graphic. Gameplay would focus on controling space balancing ugly functional stuff with pretty creatures.
		Player would take a section of the space as their final "screenshot" of the exhibit which gives them money (another resource) to buy stuff

Core Loop:
	Planning:
		Buy/Sell/Redesign your exhibit
	Day Start:
		Visitors will walk through a designated path
			They will look around and see all the creatures and give you popularity based on creature health
		Creature health (anything too high, creature dies)
			Anxiety
				More people = more anxiety | Lower with entertainment?
			Clean
				creature accumulates filth over time during day phase. must be cleaned by player interaction (clicking and holding)
			Food
				Drag and supply to creature from inventory (needs to be stocked prior to day. Automation on buying?)


Breakdown:
	Main Scene
		Player can move around various objects in a grid
			Click controls only. Drag and drop not a thing
				This could be a control setting as a stretch
		UI
			Shop
				Creatures
					Cost resources + money 
				Food
					Cost money (more valueable creatures need better foods)
				Automation items
					Stretch
			Inventory
				Creatures (they can sell creatures they dont want)
				Cage Upgrades
					Robo cleaner
					Auto Collector
					Feed-o-matic
					All-in-one
			Camera
				Popup that is X by Y size. Attaches to the grid and everything within the grid space is totaled for the final reward

Task Breakdown

Z Index
	Floor - 0
	Creatures - 1
	Visitors - 2
	Particles - 3

Collision Layers:
	1 Visitors & Tiles
	2 Pickup

Tilesets:
	Floor 
		0,0 - Empty
		1,0 - Walking
		2,0 - Start
		3,0 - Finish
		4,0 - Nothing
	
selected Action (callable)
	Action Callable is a function which gets put into the player controls for the on click

What the dudes do when they walk by
	Trigger Collision on the tileset
		tileset checks all neighbors for beauty values
			This gets added to the visitors 

Phase 1:
	[] Create a Main scene
		[x] There should be a tilemap with floor tiles and cage tiles
			[x] Floor
				[x] Empty
				[x] Border
				[x] Walking Path
				[x] Walking Start
				[x] Walking Finish
			[x] Cage
				[x] Empty Cage
				[x] Cage with Creature
		[x] Setup Phase Controls
			 // [] Place Cage
			[x] Place creature in cage
			[x] Remove Cage/Creature
			[x] Hit button to enter Open Phase
		[x] Open Phase Controls
			[x] Select Tools
				[x] Brush (cleaning)
				[x] Food (feeding)
				[x] Hand (collecting)
		[] Open Phase Mechanics
			[x] Visitors
				[x] x visitors visit (based on popularity)
				[x] Walking Animation
				[x] Increase beauty based on evaluation from nearby creatures
					[x] beauty = CreatureValue - health impairment
				[x] When they reach the finish, they increase/decrease Popularity for next day based on the beauty
			[x] Should last a specific amount of time (2 minutes?)
			//[] Once timer goes away and once all visitors leave, a popup should display sumarrizing the day
				//[] Number of customers
				//[] Profit
				//[] Resources gains
				//[] Creatures dead
				//[] etc

		[] Change the select tool to give you some stats on the creature?

To Test/Solve:
	How do visitors detect when they enter a new cell?
		Option 1:
			Simple layering. They can be an area or something overlapping tile's bodies 
		Option 2:
			They can communicate directly with the floor tilemap to map out a path and just do the calculation manually
				This will be hard. avoid if possible
		Option 3:
	How do visitors know where to pathfind?
		Option 1 (this is not viable without adding more tiles):
			Collision on the outside of the paths that keeps them between two fences, and then we just have a spawn point via the tile on the floor, and a goal via the end point
		Option 2:
			I manually calculate a path at runtime by attempting to navigate the floor tileset(should not be too hard as long as there are not two neighbors)
		Option 3:
			This is setup manually and the path is unconfigurable
				Levels?

bubblegum breakdown
	0,0 - Health
	0,1 - Dirty
	0,2 - Hungry
	0,3 - Anxious
	0,4 - Dirty + Hungry
	0,5 - Dirty + Anxious
	0,6 - Hungry + Anxious
	0,7 - Dirty + Hungry + Anxious

Graphics Needs:
	[x] Mouse Icons to see what is currently selected
		Additionally a small animation for when brushing & feeding
			Brush
			Food
			Hand
			Finger
			Hand Holding thing
	[x] Creatures
		Creature dirty
		Creature Hungry
		Creature Anxious
			Combo
				Creature dirty + Hungry
				Creature dirty + Anxious
				Creature Hungry + Anxious
				Creature dirty + hungry + anxious
	[x] Visitors
		Walking
			//Happy particles
			//Angry particles
		//Money particles on entrance
		//Popularity particles on exit

Sound Needs: #Skipping Sound alltogether for now
	Creature Sound
		On Place. Randomly through the Open Phase
	Visitor Sounds
		Happy
		Angry
	Planning Phase Background song
	Open Phase Background song

Phase 2 - Feedback Controls:
	[] Controls
		[x] Zoom and Move Camera
			[x] Scroll
			[x] WASD 
				//[] if extra time, drag movement on all actions (maybe middle click)
		[x] Click + Hold continues to clean. Auto Reset action start
	[] Visitor Feedback
		[] Indication of beautiful tile (particle spawner on the visitor object?)
		[] Indication of ugly tile
	[x] Creature Feedback
		[x] More visual clarity of filth, hunger, and anxiety
			[x] More visual clarity of when you are fixing this (maybe spawn a particle spawner at tile location that kills itself after a burst of particles)
		[x] Click on creature with general selection tools to show stats
			[x] This likely should be its own HUD separate from the other two
	[x] Display core stats on screen somewhere
	[] Feedback for being unable to place a creature in a spot

Inventory breakdown:
x	On Grab, set objectInHand to the creatureSet value (don't worry about floor editing rn)
x	On Grab from Inventory, set objectInhand to the Button's information
x	On Place, set tilemap at location equal to objectInHand and clear objectInHand
x	On Right Click (deselect), add objectInHand to inventory
x	On Removal, add object at tilemap to inventory
	Check buildCreatureSet() 
		Fix it?
			Got rid of it
	
	Inventory:
x		Update inventory clears display inventory
x			Then it creates new CreatureButtons per creature in inventory
x				Store data about creature in button
x					Button onclick does the Inventory stuff on 194
		


Creature stat breakdown:
	Name: name
	cleanlieness: clean/maxClean
	food: food/maxFood
	stress: anxiety
	production time: maxProductionTime
	produced resource: resourcename
	value: value
	
	MoveButton
	RemoveButton

Player Stat Breakdown:
	popularity
	basic_recoures
	expectation

Phase 3 - Final Game necessities:
	[] Shop & real Limited Inventory
		[] Limited Inventory
			[] Start with one BubbleGumStar
		[] Shop that sells creature and puts it in the inventory
	[] Creatures Can Die
	[] Losing
		[] Set some arbitrary payment plan thing
			[] Exponential growth necessary
	[] Path designing (part of the inventory)

Phase 4 - Making the game function
	[] Automation of tasks being available in shop (checks nearby tiles for creatures and cleans, harvests, etc them)
	[] Audio Feedback
	[] UI Improvement
	[] Setup more types of creatures (or else its just tiny creature)
